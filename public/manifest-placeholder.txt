PWA Icons Required:
- pwa-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
- pwa-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

You can generate these using any image editor or online tool.
The icons should represent a 360-degree panorama or camera icon.

For now, the app will work without these icons, but they're recommended for PWA installation.
